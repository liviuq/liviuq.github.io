# Here we are

**Hello, World** is my first official post. Jekyll is pretty nice since you can ditch
the HTML/CSS headache for a better markdown experience.

# What is this blog about?

Short answer: me and my journey. Here I post what goes through my mind in a more "structured" way.
I found writing to be calming and expressive since I don't have to pause every sentence
to carefully chain words so the person I'm talking to does not starts laughing.
This is not a bad thing, I'd laugh if I were to hear me talking.

I might post about computers, coding, tech, personal issues, politics, economy and complaints.

# Why don't you write this in a diary?

Filled up both. They don't seem to restock it anymore (Johanna Basford's Secret Garden Journal).
