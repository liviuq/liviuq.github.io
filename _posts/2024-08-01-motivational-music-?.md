# Music? What are you talking about?
Often I find myself listening to music while working or doing chores around the house and usually it's just background "melodical/rythmic" *noise*. Don't get me wrong, it is really calming and non-intrusive so that Lofi coding music can play endlessly. It does not interfere with what I'm doing in that particular point in time.

# Motivation?
It's like that moment when you go for a run and shuffle your favourite playlist, it gives you an extra boost of energy, a sudden burst of adrenaline that pushes you in that state of mind where you *feel* like you can tackle even the hardest workout.

# Some examples of such genres
I've been a daily rap/hip-hop (nowadays trap) listener and that is great until the lyrics ruined the whole song and that usually started early in the song (what a statement!). There's got to be something better out here, starting with Au Clair de la Lune there has to be something I like more. Who whould have though rock would be so good?

# Vacuuming, cleaning, working
There's rock in my ears and it makes me feel like floating on cloud nine.
